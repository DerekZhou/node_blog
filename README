Very basic blogging platform implemented on node using express, jade, and
stylus.

Most of the code is taken from
http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2011/02/07/blog-rolling-with-couchdb-express-and-node-js
with slight modifications.

Make sure you have CouchDB installed and running (this app assumes it running on
the default port - 5984)
